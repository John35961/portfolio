## About

This project started as I was looking for a way to showcase my creative and tech projects, while still building on the coding skills I acquired during spring 2022 [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon)'s bootcamp. Instead of going with a CMS or a static site generator, I went with a blank Rails app, and built a simple custom CMS from it. I believe this stack gives a lot of flexibility, and is a great way to practice my Rails skills.

## Tools

* [Ruby 3](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Rails 7](https://rubyonrails.org/) for the back-end

* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) and [StimulusJS](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) for front-end

* [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) running on a [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) instance to deploy and host the app

* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) and [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) for app monitoring

## Run locally

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:John35961/portfolio.git`

2. Run `bin/rails bundle` to install required gems in `development`

3. Then go with `bin/rails tailwindcss:install` to initialize the [tailwindcss-rails](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails) gem

4. Create database and run migrations with `bin/rails db:setup`

5. Finally, run the server with `bin/dev`

6. Then visit <http://localhost:3000>

## Main routes

* `/projects`

* `/projects/:id` where `id` is actually `Project`'s URL slug generated by [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id)

* `/dashboard`, protected route to the custom-made CMS dedicated to CRUD `Project` objects, attach relevant `Skill` and gallery images to them

* `/analytics`, protected route to [Active analytics](https://github.com/BaseSecrete/active_analytics) dashboard

## Main models

* `Project`, describing a project I've done, with attributes such as its GitHub URL, description, associated Youtube video or release date. A project can have many `Skill` objects

* `ProjectSkill`, association table between `Project`and `Skill`

* `Skill`, describing my skills. Skills can live on their own, but they make more sense when linked to a project, therefore a skill can have many `Project` objects
